django-simql
============

django-simql is a Django SimQL DB Backend. It communicates over the network and executes remote queries with it. It also takes care of token generation and processing for the queries.

SimQL is a SQL derivative but with more restricted features. Namely it does not support schema modification statements like CREATE, ALTER or DROP.
